Day -1: Arrival to Bengaluru
My day started at 7:30 am. The flight was at 12:10 pm and we had to reach airport by 11 am. Packing was left, CG papers were shown at 9 am. So, i quickly did my morning routine, freshed up and had breakfast. Unfortunately breakfast was not as per schedule. And then i went to department to see my paper. I was satisfied with my marks. I later went to hostel to shift my packed luggage to common room. That excercise under scorching sun gave me immense pleasure to leave Jaipur asap. We booked cab and cab came at 10:30 am. Now the funny thing happened was - cab driver told us that there more luggages than passengers. There was a time when we thought to book one more cab, but we managed to put luggages along with us and finally arrived airport. As we arrived at 11 am, 1hr before departure, we decided to have a look at terminal's second floor. After 3hrs we reached Bengaluru at 2:20 pm.

Now Kempegowda Airport is most beautiful airport i have ever been to. It is designed perfectly for the city like Bengaluru. Outside the airport there are food lounges, wine shops. The connectivity of airport is through buses,cabs. The buses service is called as KIAS(Kempegowda International Airport Shuttle). The airport is 47 kms off from the city. So it took 2hrs to reach JP Morgan Chase & Co. We reached PG from there ( not a tough job except crossing the road)
